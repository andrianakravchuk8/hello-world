High Hopes
Kodaline
Broken bottles in the hotel lobby
Seems to me like I'm just scared of never feeling it again
I know it's crazy to believe in silly things
But it's not that easy
I remember it now, it takes me back to when it all first started
But I've only got myself to blame for it, and I accept that now
It's time to let it go, go out and start again
But it's not that easy (that easy that easy)
High hopes, when you let it go, go out and start again
High hopes, ooh when it all comes to an end
But the world keeps spinning around
But I've got high hopes, it takes me back to when we started
High hopes, when you let it go, go out and start again
High hopes, ooh when it all comes to an end
But the world keeps spinning around
Broken bottles in the hotel lobby
Seems to me like I'm just scared of never feeling it again
I know it's crazy to believe in silly things
But it's not that easy
I remember it now, it takes me back to when it all first started
But I've only got myself to blame for it, and I accept that now
It's time to let it go, go out and start again
But it's not that easy
But I've got high hopes, it takes me back to when we started
High hopes, when you let it go, go out and start again
High hopes, ooh when it all comes to an end
But the world keeps spinning spinning
But I've got high hopes, it takes me back to when we started
High hopes, when you let it go, go out and start again
High hopes, ooh when it all comes to an end
But the world keeps spinning
